# A-BASIC-FUNCTION

in this example, the user is shown a message on the page in a html element whose id attribute has a value of message
the message is going to be changed using javascript

thes statements update the message at the top of the page the function acts like a store it holds the statements that are contained in the curly braces until you are ready to use them those statements are not run untin the function is called the fucntion is only called on the last line of this script....

i created a history of spartan's warriors with this basic function and some basic css work .......

i like to do repetition that helps you memorize it how it works very good...
